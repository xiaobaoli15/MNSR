% residual = computeResidualColumnWise(eachfeaturesTest,idPersons,...

% 
% The function computes the residual between the feature probe and the 
% reconstructed one. Eq.7.
%
% Input
%
% eachfeaturesTest: the current feature test to rank
% Dnorm: the normalized superbase (gallery set)
% Alphaband: the current reconstructed coefficient from which to start, 
% banded for that person. It refers to alpha|_i (alpha resctrited to i)
% in our paper.
% idPersons: the id for each person
%
% Output
%
% residual: the residual (error) matrix column-wise.
